# Pure Python Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors
This is a simple **Multi Processed** version of KNN algorithm that i make for my Computational Intelligence course in my University. I'm just feeling curious about it and decided to make it Multi Threaded but turns out what i need is actually multi processing.

Please use Housing Dataset for Regression and Diabetes Dataset for Classification even though it support other dataset that have similiar attributes.
